## 1 - Creating your very first component

[CodePen boilerplate](https://codepen.io/damoberg/pen/OmXBKv?editors=0010)

### 1-1 Basic task
In this task you will learn how to create a component. The component is to be very simple and should have the following features implemented:

- It should take one `prop` called name
- It should have one function only, the `render()` function
- The render function should output the following: `Hello {name}` where `{name}` should be the prop sent in to the component. 

In order to achieve this, look at the following link:

### 1-2 Second task
Now you know how to create a component. Lets crack the following problem:
We now want to be able to say: 

`Hello {Firstname} {Lastname}`. 

But instead of just sending in a new prop to the existing component. Let's make a `family`-component where we can add many different firstnames but with the same last name.
