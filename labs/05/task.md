# Give us a high five

It's time for a final task. At this point you should be familiar with components and making requests using `fetch()`. 

We have prepared a service that will register high fives. So using the same boilerplate as before. Create a react application where it's possible to press a button and send us a high five. You will find request details below. 

To be able to see the high fives we created a react component for that too. If you succeed, the counter on the following page will be increased by one. [https://codepen.io/albinhallden/pen/BRzprb](https://codepen.io/albinhallden/pen/BRzprb)

Good luck!
