# Give us a high five

## Task

It's time for a final task. At this point you should be familiar with `components`, binding `actions` and making requests using `fetch()`. 

We have prepared a service that will register high fives. So using the same boilerplate as before. Create a react application where it's possible to enter a name inside an input field and by pressing a `button` and send us a high five (with your name). You will find information about the request object below. 

To be able to see the high fives we created a react component for that too. If you succeed, the counter on the following page will be increased by one. [https://react-workshop-highfive.herokuapp.com/](https://react-workshop-highfive.herokuapp.com/)

Good luck!
