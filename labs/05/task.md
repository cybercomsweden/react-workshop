## Boilerplate

[https://codepen.io/albinhallden/pen/PmzLey](https://codepen.io/albinhallden/pen/PmzLey)

## Task

It's time for a final task. At this point you should be familiar with `components`, binding `actions` and making requests using `fetch()`. 

We have prepared a service that will register high fives. So using the same boilerplate as before. Create a react application where it's possible to press a `button` and send us a high five. You will find information about the request object below. 

To be able to see the high fives we created a react component for that too. If you succeed, the counter on the following page will be increased by one. [https://codepen.io/albinhallden/pen/BRzprb](https://codepen.io/albinhallden/pen/BRzprb)

Good luck!

## The request object

```
fetch('https://secret-brushlands-76924.herokuapp.com/high-five', {
  method: 'POST',
});
```
