# Lab 3 - Make dynamic application with state

In this lab you will learn how to use and update the component state.

[Use this boilerplate to get started](https://codepen.io/Hagerstrom/pen/mqwJyd) or reuse the CodePen from lab 1.

When implemented, the number of votes should get updated when pressing the vote button.
