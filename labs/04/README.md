## Test definition
We are about to fetch data for our React application using the `fetch()` feature (available in newer browsers).

- Add following url to the `fetch()` function 
```
https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random
```
- Dont forget to parse the response to JSON (return the response as JSON)
