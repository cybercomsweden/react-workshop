# Give us a high five

It's time for a final task. At this point you are now familiar with components and making requests using `fetch()`. 

We have prepared a service that will register high fives. So using the same boilerplate as before. Create a react application where it's possible to press a button and send us a high five. You will find request details below. Good luck!

## The request object

```
fetch('https://secret-brushlands-76924.herokuapp.com/high-five', {
  method: 'POST',
});
```
